 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.797   TIME= 23:17:25
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.797   TIME= 23:17:25
 MPC184 elements are being used in the current analysis and the          
 NLGEOM,ON command has not been used.  Thus, only linearized behavior    
 will be considered.  If finite rotation and large deflection effects    
 are to be considered, please use the NLGEOM,ON command.                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.859   TIME= 23:17:25
 Material number 18 (used by element 11391) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.578   TIME= 23:17:25
 Maximum friction coefficient 0.22 is defined in the model.  Switch to   
 the unsymmetric solver (NROP,UNSYM) instead if convergence difficulty   
 is encountered.                                                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.578   TIME= 23:17:25
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.578   TIME= 23:17:25
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 1301).                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.922   TIME= 23:17:26
 Multiple constraints have been applied on degree of freedom 3 of        
 contact node 3.  The program will remove certain internal MPCs.         
 Please check the model carefully.                                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.969   TIME= 23:17:26
 The internal constraint equation 6555 has been deleted due to           
 redundancy.  This is most likely caused by two or more constraint       
 equations that share too many degrees of freedom.                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.969   TIME= 23:17:26
 The internal constraint equation 6559 has been deleted due to           
 redundancy.  This is most likely caused by two or more constraint       
 equations that share too many degrees of freedom.                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.125   TIME= 23:17:26
 For element 11391 the element connectivity is 0 and 14139.  The node    
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.641   TIME= 23:17:26
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
