 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.781   TIME= 23:05:13
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.781   TIME= 23:05:13
 MPC184 elements are being used in the current analysis and the          
 NLGEOM,ON command has not been used.  Thus, only linearized behavior    
 will be considered.  If finite rotation and large deflection effects    
 are to be considered, please use the NLGEOM,ON command.                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.844   TIME= 23:05:13
 Material number 18 (used by element 11555) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.688   TIME= 23:05:13
 Maximum friction coefficient 0.22 is defined in the model.  Switch to   
 the unsymmetric solver (NROP,UNSYM) instead if convergence difficulty   
 is encountered.                                                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.688   TIME= 23:05:13
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.688   TIME= 23:05:13
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 1639).                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.109   TIME= 23:05:14
 Multiple constraints have been applied on degree of freedom 3 of        
 contact node 2.  The program will remove certain internal MPCs.         
 Please check the model carefully.                                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.188   TIME= 23:05:14
 The internal constraint equation 74 created by contact pair has been    
 deleted due to redundancy.  This is most likely caused by two or more   
 constraint equations that share too many degrees of freedom.            

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.297   TIME= 23:05:14
 For element 11555 the element connectivity is 0 and 14305.  The node    
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.016   TIME= 23:05:15
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
