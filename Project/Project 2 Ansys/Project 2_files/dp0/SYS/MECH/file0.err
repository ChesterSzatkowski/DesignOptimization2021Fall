/COM,ANSYS RELEASE 2021 R2           BUILD 21.2      UP20210601       15:55:07

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.562   TIME= 15:55:07
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.562   TIME= 15:55:07
 MPC184 elements are being used in the current analysis and the          
 NLGEOM,ON command has not been used.  Thus, only linearized behavior    
 will be considered.  If finite rotation and large deflection effects    
 are to be considered, please use the NLGEOM,ON command.                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.562   TIME= 15:55:07
 Material number 14 (used by element 7320) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.688   TIME= 15:55:07
 Maximum friction coefficient 0.22 is defined in the model.  Switch to   
 the unsymmetric solver (NROP,UNSYM) instead if convergence difficulty   
 is encountered.                                                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.344   TIME= 15:55:08
 For element 7320 the element connectivity is 0 and 6405.  The node      
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.500   TIME= 15:55:08
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
